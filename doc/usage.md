# Using director musices

## Starting

The first step is to start the program itself.
This is done by double clicking on the .jar file that you have downloaded.
If this does not work, you need to start a terminal/command prompt and 
`cd` into the directory of the program.
In there, type `java -jar director-musices-x.x.x-standalone.jar`.
Replace the x's with the correct version. Note that it's usually enough to
type the first part of the filename, e.g. `direct`, then press `tab` - the
terminal will then fill out the rest of the name for you.
