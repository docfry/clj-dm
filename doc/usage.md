# Using director musices

Note: *DM* is short for Director Musices.

## Starting

The first step is to start the program itself.
This is done by double clicking on the .jar file that you have downloaded.
If this does not work, you need to start a terminal/command prompt and 
`cd` into the directory of the program.
In there, type `java -jar director-musices-x.x.x-standalone.jar`.
Replace the x's with the correct version. Note that it's usually enough to
type the first part of the filename, e.g. `direct`, then press `tab` - the
terminal will then fill out the rest of the name for you.

If all went well, you should be greeted with a splash screen. After that
you should see something like this:

## Loading

Whenever something is loading, a small "bouncing ball" as well
as a short info message will be shown in the top right corner.

## Score

### Opening

There are several ways to open a score;

* By pressing *Open test score*.
* By pressing *Open from disk...*.
* From the menu, either: 
  *Open score...*, *Open performance...* or *Import score from midi file...*.

*Open from disk...* and *Open score...* does exactly the same thing.

A score is a *.mus* file, a special format created for *DM*. Specifies
a musical score.

A performance is a *.perf* file. The format is essentially the same as
a score, but contains extra information.
Read more about the difference between a score and a performance in the
[performance section](#performance).

### Saving

Essentially the same as opening.

### Score view

If you press *Open test score*, you get:
